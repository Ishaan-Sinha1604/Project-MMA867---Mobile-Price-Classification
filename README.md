# Project-MMA867---Mobile-Price-Classification
Built a smartphone pricing tool based on its features and specifications, using LASSO and Ridge Regression in Python

Built a Multi-Logistic Regression model using Python for classifying different smartphones into predetermined price segments based on features offered in the smartphone. 
Achieved 98% prediction accuracy on the dataset across all the price segments. 
Used data visualizations to explore the data and performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to deal with multicollinearity. Also performed standardization on the data using StandardScaler available in the Scikit-learn package 
Performed Feature Selection using L2 regularization technique.
